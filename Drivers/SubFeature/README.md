##What is the Sub Feature?
#####Subtraction is one of the basic arithmetic operations. It involves taking one number (the subtrahend) away from another number (the minuend). The result of subtraction is called the difference.
`For example:
In the equation
```
8 - 3 = 5
```
8 is the minuend, 3 is the subtrahend, and 5 is the difference.
