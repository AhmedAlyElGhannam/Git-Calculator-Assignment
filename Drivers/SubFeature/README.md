# Hello to Sub Feature Documentation
What is the Sub Feature?
>Subtraction is one of the basic arithmetic operations. It involves taking one number (the subtrahend) away from another number (the minuend). The result of subtraction is called the difference.

For example:

In the equation
```
8 - 3 = 5
```
8 is the minuend, 3 is the subtrahend, and 5 is the difference.

# Breakdown of what each line in the driver `SUB_FEATUE.c` do
```c
#include "Sub_Feature.h"

```
*`#include "Sub_Feature.h"`: This line tells the preprocessor to include the contents of the `Sub_Feature.h` header file.This allows the compiler to recognize functions or variables that are defined elsewhere in the project.
